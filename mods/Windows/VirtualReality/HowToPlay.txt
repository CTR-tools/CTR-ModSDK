[standalone directions, without geo-11 or VrScreenCap]

Compile the decompile for PS1 with the following defines:
#define USE_60FPS
#define USE_16BY9
#define USE_NEW2P
#define USE_VR

Must have DuckStation open with the game running,
and Quest 2 running in "Quest Link" mode, before
startin this windows program

Start OculusTest, pick a number (1, 2, or 3).
3rd-person is the least motion-sickening of all options.
1st-person (kart head) will rotate the camera based on
the head rotation of the kart character, hitting a potion
will make your head spin in circles, potentially sickening.
1st-person (velocity) will rotate the camera based on
the direction the kart is moving in, not sickening.
Both first-person modes have been hidden in CTR since 
the game shipped, they were both designed by Naughty Dog.

After picking a mode, then enter the DuckStation PID,
then put on the headset, you should see "Oculus Test" appear.
Press the Oculus Home button on your right hand, then 
with your Quest Link taskbar, select view desktop monitor.
Press L2 to make the monitor centered to your view in Quest Link
Press Select to center the headset view in CTR itself

Why we use geo-11 and VrScreenCap:

You can not "lock" the quest link monitor to your head,
so turning around 180 degrees will make you not see anything.
We just need to wait for Oculus to implement the feature "eventually".
You can view several degrees left, right, up, and down though.

Do NOT attempt this in the $19.99 app Virtual Desktop, while
that does have a desireable "lock to head" option, the VR mod
can not connect to the headset, cause you are not in Quest Link
if you are running that app.
