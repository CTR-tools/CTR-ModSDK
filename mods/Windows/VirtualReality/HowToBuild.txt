[standalone directions, without geo-11 or VrScreenCap]

Compile the decompile for PS1 with the following defines:
#define USE_60FPS
#define USE_16BY9
#define USE_NEW2P
#define USE_VR

Geo-11
Only modified config files
https://helixmod.blogspot.com/2022/06/announcing-new-geo-11-3d-driver.html

VrScreenCap
Modified "update_matrices" to remove "self.rotation"
https://github.com/artumino/VRScreenCap
inside of src/engine/entity.rs: pub fn update_matrices(...)
You must install "cargo" to build a rust demo
Do NOT compile with --release, that breaks in my experience

CTR 60fps XDELTA
Part of CTR-Tools\CTR-ModSDK github repository
This gets applied to the CTR rom

OculusTest.exe
Part of CTR-Tools\CTR-ModSDK github repository
This injects Oculus Quest data into the emulator

Runtime:

-Start OculusTest, pick a number (1, 2, or 3).
3rd-person is the least motion-sickening of all options.
1st-person (kart head) will rotate the camera based on
the head rotation of the kart character, hitting a potion
will make your head spin in circles, potentially sickening.
1st-person (velocity) will rotate the camera based on
the direction the kart is moving in, not sickening.
Both first-person modes have been hidden in CTR since 
the game shipped, they were both designed by Naughty Dog.

-Drag in DuckStation (this gets PID)
-Set options (so 16x9 and 60fps work)
-Launch the game
-Drag in vr-screen-cap-CTR

Why we use geo-11 and VrScreenCap:

You can not "lock" the quest link monitor to your head,
so turning around 180 degrees will make you not see anything.
We just need to wait for Oculus to implement the feature "eventually".
You can view several degrees left, right, up, and down though.

Do NOT attempt this in the $19.99 app Virtual Desktop, while
that does have a desireable "lock to head" option, the VR mod
can not connect to the headset, cause you are not in Quest Link
if you are running that app.
