Step 1: 
Download DuckStation, this needs to be a fresh copy of DuckStation
so that Virtual Reality does not corrupt an existing installation

Step 2:
Apply ctr-u-VirtualReality.xdelta to CTR USA rom (in .bin format)
Recommended to use the following patcher:
https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php

Step 3: 
Drag all files from geo-11 folder into DuckStation directory,
so the files are next to the DuckStation exe file

Step 4:
Open OculusTest.exe

Step 5:
As instructed by OculusTest, pick a number 1-3,
we recommend 1, but 2 and 3 are available as extras

Step 6:
Drag the DuckStation exe into OculusTest window,
then press Enter on the keyboard. Yes this is 
required, you can't just "open" DuckStation without this

Step 7:
In DuckStation, go to Settings -> Console Settings:
	check "Enable Clock Speed Control" box, 
	slide bar to 400%
	
Step 8:
In DuckStation, go to Settings -> Display Settings, 
	choose Renderer: Hardware (D3D11),
	check VSync box,
	choose Aspect Ratio: 16x9
	
Step 9:
In DuckStation, go to Settings -> Enhancement Settings, 
	choose Resolution Scale: 5x or higher, (or lower if you get lag)
	
Step 10:
Close settings window

Step 11:
Start the modified Crash Team Racing ROM,
that was built from the XDELTA

Step 12:
Wait until Naughty Dog Box Scene, then OculusTest
window will have new instructions

Step 13:
Put on your Meta headset, and enter Quest Link mode,
this can be wired link, or air link, either works.
OculusTest window will update when it detects a headset

Step 14:
If you see "Oculus Test" window in your headset,
take the headset off of your head

Step 15:
Drag vr-screen-cap-CTR.exe into OculusTest window,
then press Enter. This exe is in the same folder as OculusTest

Step 16: Put on the headset, press "Select"
on your game controller at any time to reset your view.

No audio in the headset, so put on some headphones 
that plug into your PC. Enjoy the game!
