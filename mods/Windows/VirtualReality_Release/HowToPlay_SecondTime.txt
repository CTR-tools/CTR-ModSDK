Step 1:
Open OculusTest.exe

Step 2:
As instructed by OculusTest, pick a number 1-3,
we recommend 1, but 2 and 3 are available as extras

Step 3:
Drag the DuckStation exe into OculusTest window,
then press Enter on the keyboard. Yes this is 
required, you can't just "open" DuckStation without this

Step 4:
Start the modified Crash Team Racing ROM,
that was built from the XDELTA

Step 5:
Wait until Naughty Dog Box Scene, then OculusTest
window will have new instructions

Step 6:
Put on your Meta headset, and enter Quest Link mode,
this can be wired link, or air link, either works.
OculusTest window will update when it detects a headset

Step 7:
If you see "Oculus Test" window in your headset,
take the headset off of your head

Step 8:
Drag vr-screen-cap-CTR.exe into OculusTest window,
then press Enter. This exe is in the same folder as OculusTest

Step 9: Put on the headset, press "Select"
on your game controller at any time to reset your view.

No audio in the headset, so put on some headphones 
that plug into your PC. Enjoy the game!
