Mod that adds a UI interface for editing any of the game's 65 stats across the game's playable character classes, including the Europe and Japan-exclusive stat class for Penta Penguin.

Although the game has 65 stats, only 9 of them are different across classes. These stats are marked with blue text.

Controls:

Select: open and close menu (can also be closed with Start)
L1 & R1: switch stat
L2 & R2: change driver class
Left & Right: switch stat value digit
Up & Down: increment/decrement stat value
Triangle: Print class values to console log

Currently only works properly in NTSC-U.
