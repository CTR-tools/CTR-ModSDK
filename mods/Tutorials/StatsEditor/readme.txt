an awesome mod by Superstarxalien that adds a UI interface for editing any of the game's 65 stats across the first 4 classes
penta is not implemented yet i'm lazy...
press select to bring up the menu
L1 and R1 to select stat to edit, L2 and R2 to switch class
up and down is to edit the digit
stats that are blue are stats that are different across classes, there's really only 9 unique stats per class
