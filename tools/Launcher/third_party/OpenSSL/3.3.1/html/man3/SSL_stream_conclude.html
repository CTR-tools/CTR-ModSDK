<p>SSL_stream_conclude - conclude the sending part of a QUIC stream</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code> #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

 __owur int SSL_stream_conclude(SSL *s, uint64_t flags);</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>SSL_stream_conclude() signals the normal end-of-stream condition for the send part of a QUIC stream. If called on a QUIC connection SSL object with an associated default stream, it signals the end of the single stream to the peer.</p>

<p>Any data already queued for transmission via a call to SSL_write() will still be written in a reliable manner before the end-of-stream is signalled, assuming the connection remains healthy. This function can be thought of as appending a logical end-of-stream marker after any data which has previously been written to the stream via calls to SSL_write(). Further attempts to call SSL_write() after calling this function will fail.</p>

<p>When calling this on a stream, the receive part of the stream remains unaffected, and the peer may continue to send data until it also signals the end of the stream. Thus, SSL_read() can still be used.</p>

<p><i>flags</i> is reserved and should be set to 0.</p>

<p>Only the first call to this function has any effect for a given stream; subsequent calls are no-ops. This is considered a success case.</p>

<p>This function is not supported on an object other than a QUIC stream SSL object.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.</p>

<p>Returns 0 if called on an SSL object not representing a QUIC stream.</p>
