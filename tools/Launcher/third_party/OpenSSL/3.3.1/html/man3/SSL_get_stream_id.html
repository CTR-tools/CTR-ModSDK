<p>SSL_get_stream_id, SSL_get_stream_type, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI, SSL_is_stream_local - get QUIC stream ID and stream type information</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code> #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

 uint64_t SSL_get_stream_id(SSL *ssl);

 #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE
 #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI
 #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The SSL_get_stream_id() function returns the QUIC stream ID for a QUIC stream SSL object, or for a QUIC connection SSL object which has a default stream attached.</p>

<p>The SSL_get_stream_type() function identifies what operations can be performed on the stream, and returns one of the following values:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE"><b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The SSL object is a QUIC connection SSL object without a default stream attached.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI"><b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The SSL object is a non-QUIC SSL object, or is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC connection SSL object with a default stream attached), and that stream is a bidirectional QUIC stream.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ"><b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The SSL object is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC connection SSL object with a default stream attached), and that stream is a unidirectional QUIC stream which was initiated by the remote peer; thus, it can be read from, but not written to.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE"><b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The SSL object is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC connection SSL object with a default stream attached), and that stream is a unidirectional QUIC stream which was initiated by the local application; thus, it can be written to, but not read from.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>The SSL_is_stream_local() function determines whether a stream was locally created.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>While QUICv1 assigns specific meaning to the low two bits of a QUIC stream ID, QUIC stream IDs in future versions of QUIC are not required to have the same semantics. Do not determine stream properties using these bits. Instead, use SSL_get_stream_type() to determine the stream type and SSL_get_stream_is_local() to determine the stream initiator.</p>

<p>The SSL_get_stream_type() identifies the type of a QUIC stream based on its identity, and does not indicate whether an operation can currently be successfully performed on a stream. For example, you might locally initiate a unidirectional stream, write to it, and then conclude the stream using <a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.html">SSL_stream_conclude(3)</a>, meaning that it can no longer be written to, but SSL_get_stream_type() would still return <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE</b>. The value returned by SSL_get_stream_type() does not vary over the lifespan of a stream.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>SSL_get_stream_id() returns a QUIC stream ID, or <b>UINT64_MAX</b> if called on an SSL object which is not a QUIC SSL object, or if called on a QUIC connection SSL object without a default stream attached. Note that valid QUIC stream IDs are always below 2**62.</p>

<p>SSL_get_stream_type() returns one of the <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE</b> values.</p>

<p>SSL_is_stream_local() returns 1 if called on a QUIC stream SSL object which represents a stream which was locally initiated. It returns 0 if called on a QUIC stream SSL object which represents a stream which was remotely initiated by a peer, and -1 if called on any other kind of SSL object.</p>
