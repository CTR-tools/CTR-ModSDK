<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>SSL_poll() allows the readiness conditions of the resources represented by one or more BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR structures to be determined. In particular, it can be used to query for readiness conditions on QUIC connection SSL objects and QUIC stream SSL objects in a single call.</p>

<p>A call to SSL_poll() specifies an array of <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> structures, each of which designates a resource which is being polled for readiness, and a set of event flags which indicate the specific readiness events which the caller is interested in in relation to the specified resource.</p>

<p>The fields of <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> are as follows:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="desc"><i>desc</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>The resource being polled for readiness, as represented by a <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR</b>. Currently, this must be a poll descriptor of type <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SSL</b>, representing a SSL object pointer, and the SSL object must be a QUIC connection SSL object or QUIC stream SSL object.</p>

<p>If a <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> has a poll descriptor type of <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE</b>, or the SSL object pointer is NULL, the <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> array entry is ignored and <i>revents</i> will be set to 0 on return.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="events"><i>events</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the set of zero or more events which the caller is interested in learning about in relation to the resource described by <i>desc</i>. It is a collection of zero or more <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT</b> flags. See <a href="#EVENT-TYPES">&quot;EVENT TYPES&quot;</a> for a description of each of the event types.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="revents"><i>revents</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>After SSL_poll() returns, this is the set of zero or more events which are actually applicable to the resource described by <i>desc</i>. As for <i>events</i>, it is a collection of zero or more <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT</b> flags.</p>

<p><i>revents</i> need not be a subset of the events specified in <i>events</i>, as some event types are defined as always being enabled (non-maskable). See <a href="#EVENT-TYPES">&quot;EVENT TYPES&quot;</a> for more information.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>To use SSL_poll(), call it with an array of <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> structures. The array need remain allocated only for the duration of the call. <i>num_items</i> must be set to the number of entries in the array, and <i>stride</i> must be set to <code>sizeof(SSL_POLL_ITEM)</code>.</p>

<p>The present implementation of SSL_poll() is a subset of the functionality which will eventually be available. Only a nonblocking mode of operation is available at this time, where SSL_poll() always returns immediately. As such, <i>timeout</i> must point to a valid <b>struct timeval</b> and that structure must be set to zero. In future, other inputs to the <i>timeout</i> argument will result in a blocking mode of operation, which is not currently supported. For more information, see <a href="#LIMITATIONS">&quot;LIMITATIONS&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The following flags are currently defined for the <i>flags</i> argument:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="SSL_POLL_FLAG_NO_HANDLE_EVENTS"><b>SSL_POLL_FLAG_NO_HANDLE_EVENTS</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This flag indicates that internal state machine processing should not be performed in an attempt to generate new readiness events. Only existing readiness events will be reported.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <i>result_count</i> argument is optional. If it is non-NULL, it is used to output the number of entries in the array which have nonzero <i>revents</i> fields when the call to SSL_poll() returns; see <a href="#RETURN-VALUES">&quot;RETURN VALUES&quot;</a> for details.</p>

<h1 id="EVENT-TYPES">EVENT TYPES</h1>

<p>The SSL_poll() interface reports zero or more event types on a given resource, represented by a bit mask.</p>

<p>All of the event types are level triggered and represent a readiness or permanent exception condition; as such, after an event has been reported by SSL_poll() for a resource, it will continue to be reported in future SSL_poll() calls until the condition ceases to be in effect. A caller must mask the given event type bit in future SSL_poll() calls if it does not wish to receive repeated notifications and has not caused the underlying readiness condition (for example, consuming all available data using <a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.html">SSL_read_ex(3)</a> after <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_R</b> is reported) to be deasserted.</p>

<p>Some event types do not make sense on a given kind of resource. In this case, specifying that event type in <i>events</i> is a no-op and will be ignored, and the given event will never be reported in <i>revents</i>.</p>

<p>Failure of the polling mechanism itself is considered distinct from an exception condition on a resource which was successfully polled. See <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> and <a href="#RETURN-VALUES">&quot;RETURN VALUES&quot;</a> for details.</p>

<p>In general, an application should always listen for the event types corresponding to exception conditions if it is listening to the corresponding non-exception event types (e.g. <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b> and <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER</b> for <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_R</b>), as not doing so is unlikely to be a sound design.</p>

<p>Some event types are non-maskable and may be reported in <i>revents</i> regardless of whether they were requested in <i>events</i>.</p>

<p>The following event types are supported:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_F"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Polling failure. This event is raised when a resource could not be polled. It is distinct from an exception condition reported on a resource which was successfully polled and represents a failure of the polling process itself in relation to a resource. This may mean that SSL_poll() does not support the kind of resource specified.</p>

<p>Where this event is raised on at least one item in <i>items</i>, SSL_poll() will return 0 and the ERR stack will contain information pertaining to the first item in <i>items</i> with <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> set. See <a href="#RETURN-VALUES">&quot;RETURN VALUES&quot;</a> for more information.</p>

<p>This event type may be raised even if it was not requested in <i>events</i>; specifying this event type in <i>events</i> does nothing.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Error at connection level. This event is raised when a connection has failed. In particular, it is raised when a connection begins terminating.</p>

<p>This event is never raised on objects which are not connections.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_DCD"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_DCD</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Error at connection level (drained). This event is raised when a connection has finished terminating, and has reached the terminated state. This event will generally occur after an interval of time passes after the <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b> event is raised on a connection.</p>

<p>This event is never raised on objects which are not connections.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Error in read direction. For QUIC, this is raised only in the event that a stream has a read part and that read part has been reset by the peer (for example, using a <b>RESET_STREAM</b> frame).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_EW"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EW</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Error in write direction. For QUIC, this is raised only in the event that a stream has a write part and that write part has been reset by the peer using a <b>STOP_SENDING</b> frame.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_R"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_R</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Readable. This event is raised when a QUIC stream SSL object (or a QUIC connection SSL object with a default stream attached) has application data waiting to be read using <a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.html">SSL_read_ex(3)</a>, or a FIN event as represented by <b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b> waiting to be read.</p>

<p>It is not raised in the event of the receiving part of the QUIC stream being reset by the peer; see <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER</b>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_W"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_W</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Writable. This event is raised when a QUIC stream SSL object (or a QUIC connection SSL object with a default stream attached) could accept more application data using <a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.html">SSL_write_ex(3)</a>.</p>

<p>This event is never raised by a receive-only stream.</p>

<p>This event is never raised by a stream which has had its send part concluded normally (as with <a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.html">SSL_stream_conclude(3)</a>) or locally reset (as with <a href="../man3/SSL_stream_reset.html">SSL_stream_reset(3)</a>).</p>

<p>This event does not guarantee that a subsequent call to <a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.html">SSL_write_ex(3)</a> will succeed.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISB"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISB</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when one or more incoming bidirectional streams are available to be accepted using <a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.html">SSL_accept_stream(3)</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISU"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISU</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when one or more incoming unidirectional streams are available to be accepted using <a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.html">SSL_accept_stream(3)</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSB"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSB</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when QUIC stream creation flow control currently permits at least one additional bidirectional stream to be locally created.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSU"><b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSU</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when QUIC stream creation flow control currently permits at least one additional unidirectional stream to be locally created.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</h1>

<p>SSL_poll() as presently implemented has the following limitations:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The implementation of SSL_poll() only supports nonblocking operation and therefore requires the <i>timeout</i> argument be used to specify a zero timeout. Calls to SSL_poll() which specify another value, or which pass <i>timeout</i> as NULL, will fail. This does not allow waiting, but does allow multiple QUIC SSL objects to be queried for their readiness state in a single call.</p>

<p>Future releases will remove this limitation and support blocking SSL_poll().</p>

</li>
<li><p>Only <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures with type <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SSL</b>, referencing QUIC connection SSL objects or QUIC stream SSL objects, are supported.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>These limitations will be revised in a future release of OpenSSL.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>SSL_poll() returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.</p>

<p>Unless the <i>items</i> pointer itself is invalid, SSL_poll() will always initialise the <i>revents</i> fields of all items in the input array upon returning, even if it returns failure.</p>

<p>If <i>result_count</i> is non-NULL, it is always written with the number of items in the array with nonzero <i>revents</i> fields, even if the SSL_poll() call returns failure.</p>

<p>It is possible for <i>result_count</i> to be written as 0 even if the SSL_poll() call returns success, namely if no events were output but the polling process was successful (e.g. in nonblocking usage) or timed out.</p>

<p>It is possible for <i>result_count</i> to be written as a nonzero value if the SSL_poll() call returns failure, for example due to <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> events, or because some events were detected and output before encountering a failure condition while processing a subsequent entry in the <i>items</i> array.</p>

<p>If at least one <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> event is output, SSL_poll() is guaranteed to return 0 and guaranteed to place at least one ERR on the error stack describing the first <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> output. Detailed information on any additional <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> events is not available. SSL_poll() may or may not return more than one <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> event at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Normal&quot; events representing exceptional I/O conditions which do not constitute a failure of the SSL_poll() mechanism itself are not considered errors by SSL_poll() and are instead represented using their own event type; see <a href="#EVENT-TYPES">&quot;EVENT TYPES&quot;</a> for details.</p>

<p>The caller can establish the meaning of the SSL_poll() return and output values as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If SSL_poll() returns 1 and <i>result_count</i> is zero, the operation timed out before any resource was ready.</p>

</li>
<li><p>If SSL_poll() returns 1 and <i>result_count</i> is nonzero, that many events were output.</p>

</li>
<li><p>If SSL_poll() returns 0 and <i>result_count</i> is zero, the caller has made a basic usage error; check the ERR stack for details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>If SSL_poll() returns 0 and <i>result_count</i> is nonzero, inspect the <i>items</i> array for <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> structures with the <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> event type raised in <i>revents</i>. The entries added to the ERR stack (of which there is guaranteed to be at least one) reflect the cause of the failure of the first item in <i>items</i> with <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> raised. Note that there may be events other than <i>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</i> output for items which come before the first item with <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> raised, and additional <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> events may or may not have been output, both of which which will be reflected in <i>result_count</i>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
