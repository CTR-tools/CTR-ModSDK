 * @brief CD-ROM library header
 *
 * @details The PSn00bSDK CD-ROM library provides facilities for using the
 * CD-ROM hardware of the PS1. Unlike the CD-ROM library of the official SDK,
 * psxcd is immune to the 30 file and directory limit and is capable of parsing
 * directories containing as many files as the ISO9660 file system can support,
 * unless the records are too large to be loaded into memory. However, to
 * maintain compatibility with the PS1 BIOS, the root directory must not exceed
 * the 30 file limit and the entire disc should contain no more than 45
 * directories total.
 *
 * Whilst psxcd is not constrained by the 30 file per directory limit, it does
 * not support Joliet CD-ROM extensions to support long file names. However, a
 * library extension is considered for future development.
