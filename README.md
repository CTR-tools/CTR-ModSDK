This repository also houses an effort to fully decompile and reverse-engineer [CTR in C.](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK#CTR-in-C)

This SDK uses:
- [psx-modding-tools](https://github.com/mateusfavarin/psx-modding-toolchain) by [mateusfavarin](https://github.com/mateusfavarin) for injecting and testing code
- [CTR-Tools](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-Tools) by [DCxDemo](https://github.com/DCxDemo) for parsing and extracting the game files

# üìÉ Features

- Extract and build ISO in few steps
- Supports all retail versions and two prototypes
- Compile C code into any address and overlay
- Integrated Xdelta patch generation
- Hot Swap: Load code replacements while the game is running

# üèÅ How to Start Modding

## Requirements

- [python 3+](https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python)
- Open command prompt (CMD/Terminal) and install the dependencies:
```
pip install requests
pip install opencv-python
```

## Downloading the SDK

Clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CTR-Tools/CTR-ModSDK.git
```

- You can find [example mods](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK/tree/main/psx-modding-toolchain/games/CrashTeamRacing/mods) in our repo.
- Each mod folder includes a `readme.txt` file on what the mod does and how to use it. 
- To build a mod, simply run `build.bat` in the mod folder.

# CTR-in-C

Work-in-progress project to decompile Crash Team Racing into human-readable C code.

[![Decompile Overview](https://img.youtube.com/vi/V9QlFzSVDAU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9QlFzSVDAU)

## üìä Progress
### Decompilation, Research and Documentation

Decompiling the binaries assisted by Ghidra, researching how it works and documentating them with comments.

### Code Rewrite

Rewriting Ghidra output to human-readable C Code and testing if it's functional.
Most of the source code are shared between versions.

### How to rewrite functions:

- Make sure you have cloned this repo and installed the requirements.
- Choose a .c file from [ghidra](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK/tree/main/psx-modding-toolchain/games/CrashTeamRacing/ghidra) folder. Each file represents a code section or category. All non-numbered .c files are parts of the main EXE while the numbered files are overlays.
- Choose a function in that section to rewrite. Read the documentation comments on what the function does and what's the address.
- Add a new line for your new function to [buildList.txt](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK/blob/main/psx-modding-toolchain/games/CrashTeamRacing/decompile/buildList.txt) with this format:
```
common*, exe**, <name of original function to replace>, 0x0,  <rewritten function .c file>
```
\* Build codenames:  
common: All versions;  
926: USA Retail;  
1006: Japan Trial;  
1020: Europe Retail;  
1111: Japan Retail.  

\**  Code region:  
exe: main EXE;  
221-233: Overlays (use the original .c filename number)

- Run `build.bat` and choose "Compile", "build ISO", then test the game.
- After you've confirmed that it's functional, add your new function c file to the [decompile directory](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK/tree/main/psx-modding-toolchain/games/CrashTeamRacing/decompile).
- Now you can make a pull request
