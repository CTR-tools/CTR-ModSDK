The Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled gameplay experience recreated in the
original CTR* -- reserves kept on U-Turns, USF that can be stacked with power
sliding, and blue fire! Made by TheRedhotbr. For US and PAL, it includes custom
graphics for the title screen and start flags made by Avery (@TheMagicJam)
and LinkZer. Blue fire color swap by Avery.

*Doesn't include stilted physics, automated jumps, "propietary code takeovers",
or polswid.

This mod automatically enables the cheat code to turn every turbo pad into
a "blue fire" turbo pad, and sets reserves of all blue fire pads to 1 second.
